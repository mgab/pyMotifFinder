# pyMotifFinder

This is a module with utilities to find network motifs.

It is written for educative purposes using either trivial or already available
algorithms. It has an emphasis on using an approach easy to understand, which
means that it does not use more complex state-of-the-art algorithms. In other words,
do not expect it to have a great performance or to be usable in too large
networks.
